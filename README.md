# Summary
According to Owen L Brown, the writer of the iBeacon tutorial said, ​“​An iBeacon is nothing more than a Bluetooth Low Energy device that advertises information in a specific structure.” In plain terms iBeacon is essentially a GPS that can have better accuracy especially inside of steel and concrete building where the signal is less than adequate.

The utilization of a Bluetooth signal is what makes this very powerful at close ranges, compared to a GPS signal. Typically iBeacon is a secondary tiny external piece of hardware that acts like a reciever. Owen said, “If you don’t have an iBeacon but have a second iOS device, you might be able to use it as a beacon.”
